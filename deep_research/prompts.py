        "2. It breaks it down into one English search query and one Arabic search query in parallel.\n"
        "3. It searches those queries and retrieves the top two most relevant urls for each query.\n"
        "4. It scrapes the .html of those websites.\n"
        "5. It processes the scraped information from those websites and summarizes it an abstract-like paragraph for each website in parallel.\n"
        "6. In a loop, it evaluates the original user query, the searched queries, the summaries, and then determines what follow-up queries are needed to fully answer the user's original query, going back to step 3.\n"

        " • 5 or 6 loops for reports or detailed strategies.\n"
        "Queries that would require only 1 loop are \"What's the weather like today in Doha?\" or \"What's the latest iPhone model\"\n"
        "Queries that would require 2 loops are \"Who wrote One Hundred Years of Solitude and when was it first published\" or \"What are the main differences between a laptop and a tablet?\"\n"
        "Queries that would require 3 loops are \"What are the health benefits and potential side effects of drinking green tea?\" or \"Compare the climates of Southern California and the Pacific Northwest in the summer.\"\n"
        "Queries that would require 4 loops are \"Provide an overview of the potential impacts of climate change on global food security, including specific regional examples.\" or \"Create a detailed 2-day itinerary for a first-time visitor to New York City on a moderate budget, including recommendations for attractions, food, and transportation.\"\n"
        "Queries that would require 5 loops are \"Compare ETFs and mutual funds on liquidity, tax efficiency, and cost\" or \"Recommend three caching strategies to reduce read latency in a RESTful API.\"\n"
        "Queries that would require 6 loops are \"Develop a beginner's guide to investing in the stock market, covering different investment strategies, types of assets, risk management, and recommended platforms for a young investor.\" or \"Analyze the evolution of artificial intelligence in the last decade, highlighting key technological breakthroughs, major ethical concerns, and its growing influence on various industries.\"\n"
